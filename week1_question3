Java Week 1:Q3

Consider First n even numbers starting from zero(0).Complete the code segment to calculate sum of  all the numbers divisible by 3 from 0 to n.Print the sum.

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Exercise1_3 {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
	   Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
	   int n=sc.nextInt();
	  int sum=0;
//Use for or while loop to sum first n positive even numbers starting from 0 which are divisible by 3.
int i;
for(i=0;i<=n;i++){
  if(i%3==0){
   sum=sum+2*i; 
  }
 
}
 System.out.println(sum);  
 }
 }
