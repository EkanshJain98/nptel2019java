Java Week 3: Q1

This program is related to the generation of Fibonacci numbers.

For example: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,â€¦ is a Fibonacci sequence where 13 is the 8th Fibonacci number. A partial code is given and you have to complete the code as per the instruction given as comments.

import java.util.Scanner; //This package for reading input
public class Fibonacci { 
    
    public static void main(String args[]) { 
	 Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
	 int n=sc.nextInt(); //Read an integer
        System.out.println(fib(n)); //Generate and print the n-th Fibonacci                
                                     //number
    } 
 static int fib(int n) {
int f=0,f1=-1,f2=1;

for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
 f=f1+f2;
  f1=f2;
  f2=f;
  
}
return f;

//complete the code segment to find the nth Fibonacci number in the Fibonacci sequence and return the value. Write the function recursively.
}
}
